                    Mr. Mandela is admitted to the University of Fort Hare, a black institution. Two years later he will be expelled for leading a student protest.

                <li>
                    <b> 1944 First Marriage </b>-
                    Mr. Mandela marries Evelyn Ntoko Mase. The couple will have four children, but Mr. Mandela’s political activities will put a strain on the relationship. The couple will divorce in 1958.

                    <b>1944 Forms the A.N.C. Youth League </b>-
                    Mr. Mandela and other activists form the African National Congress Youth League after becoming disenchanted with the cautious approach of the older members of the A.N.C. The league’s formation marks the shift of the congress to a mass movement. But its manifesto, so charged with pan-African nationalism, offends some non-black sympathizers.
